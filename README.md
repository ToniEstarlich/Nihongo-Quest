Nihongo Quest features several interactive sections, each designed to enhance the learning experience: **Home**, **Alphabet**, **Flashcards**, **Manga**, and **Quiz**. Below are the wireframes for the four main sections: 

## - Design Iteration  

The project started with wireframes to outline the main sections: Home, Flashcards, Alphabet, Manga, and Quiz.  

- Early versions were simple and focused mainly on functionality.  
- Based on feedback, the design was refined to improve navigation, responsiveness, and visual consistency.  
- A color palette inspired by Japanese culture and a custom logo were introduced to give the app a stronger identity.  
- Iterations also focused on UI/UX improvements, such as adjusting button placement, form validation, and adding motivational feedback during quizzes.  
- later expanded the app in add imagens.

# EXAMPLE OF ALGORITHM & CODE:

## üìå Quiz Function Explanation
The `quiz()` function handles the quiz logic in a Flask web application. It:

- Displays a form with words from the database.
- Processes user answers and checks correctness.
- Uses Flask routes, loops, if-else conditions, dictionaries, and flash messages.
- Requires user authentication `(@login_required)`.
- Redirects users after submission.

## üìå Code analysis of word.py:

Flask and PostgreSQL.
```python
# 1. Importing Dependencies: "word.py"  
from flask import current_app
from extensions import db

class Word(db.Model):  #  2. Defining the `Word` Model: "Defines a SQLAlchemy model for a database table"
   
    #  3. Defining Database Columns:
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)  # Unique ID for each word (Primary Key)
    japanese = db.Column(db.String(100), nullable=False)  # Japanese word (max 100 chars)
    english = db.Column(db.String(100), nullable=False)  # English translation (max 100 chars)

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"<Word {self.japanese} - {self.english}>"  # String representation for debugging

```

## üîç Code with Detailed Comments

```python
# Function: Defines a route for the quiz page
@app.route("/quiz", methods=["GET", "POST"])  # Flask route decorator
@login_required  # Restricts access to logged-in users
def quiz():  # Function definition
    words = Word.query.all()  # Query database (Array/List of objects)
    feedback = {}  # Dictionary to store feedback

    # If-Else Condition: Checks if the request method is POST (Form submitted)
    if request.method == "POST":
        answers = {}  # Dictionary to store user's answers
        correct_answers = 0  # Counter for correct answers
        total_questions = 0  # Counter for total questions

        # For Loop: Iterates over each word in the database
        for word in Word.query.all():
            answer_key = f"answer_{word.id}"  # Generates form key dynamically
            user_answer = request.form.get(answer_key, "").strip()  # Gets user input
            correct_answer = word.english.strip()  # Fetches correct answer

            # If Condition: Compares user input with the correct answer (Case insensitive)
            if user_answer.lower() == correct_answer.lower():
                correct_answers += 1  # Increments correct answer count

            total_questions += 1  # Increments total question count
            answers[word.id] = user_answer  # Stores user's answer in dictionary

        # If-Else Condition: Provides feedback based on quiz performance
        if correct_answers == total_questions:
            flash("Perfect score! All answers are correct. üéâ", "success")  # Success message
        elif correct_answers > 0:
            flash(f"{correct_answers} correct answers. Keep practicing!üí™", "warning")  # Encouragement
        else:
            flash("No correct answers. Keep practicing! üí™", "danger")  # Motivational message

        return redirect(url_for("index"))  # Redirects to homepage after submission

    # Else If Condition: Handles GET request (Displays quiz form)
    elif request.method == "GET":
        words = Word.query.all()  # Fetches all words from database

    return render_template("quiz.html", words=words)  # Renders quiz page

## ‚úÖ Summary algorithm
- This function is responsible for handling quiz logic in the Flask app.
- Uses database queries to fetch words from the database.
- Uses a for loop to iterate through words and compare answers.
- Implements flash messages to give users feedback.
- Uses redirect() to send users back to the homepage after submission.

quiz.html end explanation:
```html
<!-- 1. Page Header: "Displays the title of the quiz page" -->
<h1>Japanese Quiz</h1>

<!-- 2. Form Setup: "Defines a form that submits data to the '/quiz' route via POST" -->
<form action="{{ url_for('quiz')}}" method="POST">

    <!-- 3. CSRF Token: "Prevents CSRF attacks for security" -->
    <input type="hidden" name="csrf_token" value="{{ csrf_token() }}">

    <!-- 4. Looping Through Words: "Displays each Japanese word and an input box for the answer" -->
    {% for word in words %}
       <p>What is the meaning of "{{ word.japanese }}"?</p>
       <input type="text" name="answer_{{ word.id }}" 
       class="{% if feedback and feedback[word.id] == 'correct' %}correct{% elif feedback and feedback[word.id] == 'incorrect' %}incorrect{% endif %}">
    {% endfor %}

    <!-- 5. Submit Button: "Sends the user's answers for evaluation" -->
    <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>

<!-- 6. Return Link: "Navigates back to the homepage" -->

## Problems and Solutions  

### Pages to references: 
 - **[Flask-WTF](https://flask-wtf.readthedocs.io/en/1.2.x/)** 

### ‚ùå **Problem: CSRF Token Errors in Quiz Form**  
- **Issue:** The CSRF token was missing or not being validated correctly in the form submission.  
- **Solution:**  
  - Ensured that `CSRFProtect(app)` was correctly initialized in `app.py`.  
  - Passed the CSRF token explicitly in `render_template()`.  
  - Added a hidden input field in `quiz.html` to include the CSRF token in the form.  

### ‚ùå **Problem: Understanding Mako Templates**  
- **What is Mako?**  
  Mako is a templating engine for Python, similar to Jinja2 but with a syntax closer to standard Python expressions.  
  - **Why is it relevant?** Mako is sometimes used in Flask applications when working with certain frameworks or plugins that require an alternative template engine.  
  - **In Nihongo Quest:** We are using Jinja2 (Flask's default template engine), so Mako is not needed for now. However, understanding Mako can be useful for other Python projects.
