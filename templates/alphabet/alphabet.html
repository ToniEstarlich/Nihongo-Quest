        <p>
            The Japanese writing system is unique, consisting of three alphabets: Hiragana, Katakana, and Kanji. 
            Each has its own purpose and historical background. Kanji, originally borrowed from Chinese characters, 
            form the foundation of Japanese writing and represent entire words or concepts. However, since Kanji can be complex, 
            two phonetic alphabets were developed: <strong>Hiragana</strong> and <strong>Katakana</strong>.  
            <br><br>
            <strong>Hiragana</strong> was historically created by women in the Heian period as a more fluid and cursive way to write 
            Japanese sounds, making it the primary script for native words, grammatical elements, and informal writing.  
            <br><br>
            <strong>Katakana</strong>, on the other hand, has a more angular and rigid appearance and was developed by Buddhist monks 
            and scholars, historically used by men. Today, it is mainly used for foreign words, foreign names, loanwords, 
            and emphasis (similar to italics in English).  
            <br><br>
            Mastering these three alphabets is essential for reading and writing Japanese fluently!

                <p>
                    Hiragana is a fundamental part of the Japanese writing system and is primarily used for native Japanese words, 
                    grammatical elements, and verb conjugations. Developed during the Heian period, it was historically used by women 
                    who were not allowed to study Chinese characters (Kanji). Its flowing, curved strokes give it a softer appearance, 
                    making it easier to write quickly. Hiragana is often the first script that Japanese learners encounter, as it is 
                    essential for forming complete sentences and reading Japanese text fluently.

                <h6 class="alphabet">(Katakana)</h6>
                <p>
                    Katakana is a more angular and block-like script primarily used for foreign loanwords, names, and onomatopoeia. 
                    It was originally developed by Buddhist monks as a shorthand for reading classical Chinese texts. Due to its 
                    distinct, sharp appearance, it is commonly used for emphasis, much like italics in English. In modern Japan, 
                    Katakana is widely seen in advertisements, scientific terms, and the names of foreign brands. While less commonly 
                    used than Hiragana, mastering Katakana is crucial for reading menus, product names, and foreign words in Japanese.

                <p>
                    Kanji are logographic characters borrowed from Chinese and serve as the foundation of written Japanese. Unlike 
                    Hiragana and Katakana, which represent sounds, each Kanji character conveys meaning. There are thousands of Kanji, 
                    but around 2,000 are commonly used in daily life. Learning Kanji can be challenging, as most characters have multiple 
                    pronunciations depending on context. However, Kanji help shorten text and make Japanese writing more efficient. 
                    Mastering Kanji is essential for reading newspapers, books, and official documents in Japan.
